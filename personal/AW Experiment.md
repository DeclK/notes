   |Car         |64.57       |73.05       |42.91       |13.30       |
   |Bus         |58.79       |64.71       |59.71       |16.08       |
   |Pedestrian  |52.18       |55.28       |42.13       |6.50        |
   |Cyclist     |48.38       |50.18       |43.34       |30.73       |
   |mAP         |55.98       |60.81       |47.02       |16.65       |
   ```

   **比历史模型指标低很多，正在排查数据问题?**

2. IoU rectification $\lambda=0.5$

   ```txt
   |AP@50       |overall     |0-30m       |30-50m      |50m-inf     |
   |Car         |66.21       |74.85       |45.54       |14.94       |
   |Bus         |61.01       |68.67       |60.04       |14.57       |
   |Pedestrian  |56.85       |60.58       |44.99       |7.08        |
   |Cyclist     |53.40       |56.05       |47.09       |31.01       |
   |mAP         |59.37       |65.04       |49.41       |16.90       |
   ```

3. IoU regression 相比 baseline 有一个点的提升吧

   ```txt
   |AP@50       |overall     |0-30m       |30-50m      |50m-inf     |
   |Car         |65.11       |73.75       |44.48       |13.12       |
   |Bus         |60.51       |67.70       |60.55       |12.83       |
   |Pedestrian  |53.23       |56.29       |43.85       |9.30        |
   |Cyclist     |49.14       |50.74       |43.74       |32.11       |
   |mAP         |57.00       |62.12       |48.16       |16.84       |
   ```
