my name is Mr. Owl

I will shortly lead you through a guided hypnosis

please don't listen to this while driving or operating machinery

you may also want to have a glass of water nearby

it can help ground you after a recession

I would like you to start by simply lying down in a comfortable position 

perhaps on some cushions

or on a couch

and just take a few moments to relax your mind

(a moment ...)

in a moment

I'm going to ask you to imagine a place

a special place

you may see it

feel it

imagine it or experience it

in any way you want

and you might find your mind wondering quite a bit

but that doesn't matter to you

the sound of my voice will continue to relax you

and it doesn't matter if you don't hear a word I say

because very soon now

you are going to be relaxed

more than you have ever known

imagine now that you are in that place

that place you know well

a hotel by a lake

and you are here 

at the top of a gorgeous staircase

in a large open hallway

a really beautiful old hotel

it's such a comfortable temperature here

daylight streams in through the window

slightly warm

such a peaceful place to be

and at the bottom of those stairs

an open doorway

leading to a garden

in a few moments

I will count

from 1 to 10

and count you down each step

let each number

represent a step

and each step takes you deeper and deeper

into relaxation

so that by the time I get to ten

you can allow yourself

to be as deeply relaxed

as you ever can be

and you'll still hear

the sound of my voice

and as you look down

you can glimpse

through the open door

that intriguing garden

it's so interesting to you

to explore and discover

this special place

the sunlight to the windows on your skin

there's no one around

that needs anything from you

no one around

to bother you

1

when you are ready

take your first step now

relaxing letting go

2

take another step

feeling more at ease

and at peace with yourself

3

perhaps noticing

heavy

restful feeling

spreading down your legs

with every step

4

just drifting deeper

and deeper down

5

another step

becoming calmer

and even calmer still

continuing to relax

continuing to let go

and feeling so good

6

perhaps beginning to notice

any sounds becoming part of your experience of comfort

relaxation

and anything you notice

becoming part of your experience

7

sinking deeper and deeper

drifting

further

into this welcoming

relaxed state

8

enjoying those feelings

half awake

half asleep

9

noticing way of growing relaxation

and spreading comfort

10

an now

at the bottom of the stairs

and wandering through that open door

how into the gardon beyond

soak up those feelings of

tranquility

see

hear

feel sense or imagine this

beautiful garden

the greens

the flowers

the trees

the brown

the clear blue sky

feel the warmth of the sun

on your head and shoulders

enjoy a moment here

and peace

inhale the sense of the garden

there is no one around

wanting anything from you

needing anything from you

no one expecting anything

so enjoy this

peace

and quiet

for a few moments more

notice now

at the end of this garden

a set of steps

leading down to a sturdy pier

at the edge of lake

so now

take the steps now

sinking further and further into relaxation

as you do

more and more relaxed with each step

until you step onto the wooden pier

then stepping forward

towards that beautiful crystal blue water

the sun on your skin

and gentle breeze

and here

at the end of the pier

a fishing rod

You take it in your hand

feel a comforting weight of it

not too heavy to hold

but you know that it's strong and sturdy

it will not struggle with the weight of today's catch

slowly and deliberately

you unravel some of the line

you pull back the rod

and cast that line into that crystal

clear

blue water

it sits in that water for a moment

and soon you feel a gentle pull on the fishing rod

you've caught something

you gently crank back the handle

pulling your catch out of the water

what have you caught

it's a white cube

so square and perfect on every side

a little water drips from it

as you gently swing it back onto the pier beside you

you lower the fishing rod to your side

and you take

the white cube from the line

what's inside this cube

it's a memory

a good memory

a memory from your life

a memory of a time when you were happy

and strong

and confident

you pick up the cube

you hold it close to your face

and now you can see this memory

you see it in a vivid wide screen

The colors are rich

the image is bright

the sound is clear and strong and vibrant

so strong and vibrant that you step into this memory

you are inside

let those feelings grow inside you

feeling happy and strong and confident and bright

take a moment to enjoy this

to live in it

to breathe

this beautiful positive memory from the white cube

feeling strong and confident

and bright and happy

now

slowly

and with care

you move out of the memory

and you lower the cube

from in front of your face

and se t it down gently on the pier beside you

take a moment now

look out

onto the lake

at the cool blue water

the peace

tranquility of it

you kneel down and lower the white cube

into the peaceful water

and as the ripples slow and stop

you catch sight of your own reflection

and you see how beautiful you are

how strong you are

you can see positivity in your eye

like jewels

you stand and look out at that lake

calm serene and full of power

breathe it in gently

and then breathe it out gently

all that power that's within you

I let you enjoy those feelings for a few moments more

allow you time to bask in that life

but soon

soon I'll start count from one up to five

when I reach five

you will be back in the room

1

starting to come back

become aware of your breathing

your body and the space around you

2

moving your legs start to wiggle your toes and feet

a lovely grounding energy, traveling up your legs

3

moving your arms starting to stretch, feel the energy moving through your body again

4 

your eyes starting to open

And on the next count your eyes fully open 

5

eyes fully open, feeling refreshed and recharged and being fully aware of being in the space

welcome back
