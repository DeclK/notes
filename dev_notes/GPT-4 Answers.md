## Tennis Pose Similarity

> Iâ€˜m now working on a tennis project using deep learning and pose estimation. Now I want to estimate the pose similarity between 2 people, how can I do it? what do you suggest, you can elaborate on it

To estimate the pose similarity between two people in your tennis project using deep learning and pose estimation, you can follow these steps:

1. Pose estimation: First, you need to extract the pose keypoints for each person in the images or video frames using a pose estimation model like OpenPose, PoseNet, or DensePose. These models will give you a set of 2D or 3D coordinates for various body keypoints such as head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.
2. Data preprocessing: Normalize the pose keypoints to remove any scale, rotation, or translation differences between the two people. This can be done using techniques like Procrustes analysis or by aligning the root joint (e.g., hips) and scaling based on the torso length or limb lengths.
3. Feature extraction: Calculate relevant features for pose similarity comparison. Some common features include joint angles, limb lengths, and the relative position of keypoints. You can also calculate higher-level features such as joint angle velocities and accelerations if you're working with video data.
4. Pose similarity metric: Choose a similarity metric to compare the pose features. Some popular metrics include:

a. Euclidean distance: Calculate the Euclidean distance between the corresponding pose keypoints or features. A smaller distance indicates higher similarity.

b. Cosine similarity: Calculate the cosine similarity between the pose feature vectors. A value closer to 1 indicates higher similarity.

c. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW): If you're working with time series data, such as video frames, you can use DTW to measure the similarity between the two pose sequences, considering possible time shifts.

d. Custom similarity metric: If you have domain-specific knowledge, you can design your own similarity metric to better capture the characteristics of tennis-related poses.

1. Thresholding or classification: Depending on your project's goal, you can set a threshold on the similarity metric to determine if two poses are similar or not. Alternatively, you can use a classifier (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or a neural network) to learn the boundary between similar and dissimilar poses based on labeled training data.
2. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your pose similarity estimation using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, or accuracy, based on a labeled test dataset.

Remember, the choice of pose estimation model, features, and similarity metric will depend on your specific project requirements and the quality of your input data. You may need to experiment with different combinations to achieve the desired level of accuracy and robustness.
