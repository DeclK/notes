## What is L4T & JetsonPack

From ChatGPT: what is L4T?

> L4T, which stands for Linux for Tegra, is a software platform provided by NVIDIA designed specifically for the NVIDIA Tegra processor family. It includes a highly optimized version of the Linux operating system along with drivers, APIs, and developmental tools that are tailored to support the features and capabilities of Tegra processors. For devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin, which is part of the NVIDIA Jetson series aimed at enabling AI and machine learning applications at the edge, L4T provides the necessary foundation to develop, deploy, and run complex AI models and applications directly on the device.

From ChatGPT: what is JetPack?

> JetPack SDK is a software development kit provided by NVIDIA for the Jetson platform, which includes a suite of software tools and technologies for developing applications on NVIDIA Jetson embedded computing boards.

从二者的关系上来说：JetPack 包含 L4T，也就是说 JetPack 是 L4T 的一个超集，其还包括一些深度学习、CUDA 相关的库/SDK
